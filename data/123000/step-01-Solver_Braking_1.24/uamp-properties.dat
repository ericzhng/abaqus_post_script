# Each variable is defined on two lines. The first line defines the uampType and the Abaqus step number where it's used.
# The second line contains its properties. Depending on the type of boundary condition:
# - for velocity: stepTime, magnitude, curveType, (freeRollingOmega/radius)
# - for force/torque: errorTolerance, slope, magnitude
